- Processing speed depends on your hardware and video resolution.
- For best results in crowded scenes, the app uses the YOLOv5x model.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Biggest Disadvantage
-YOLOv5x.pt is not enough for crowded(more than 50-100 people). If you need more trustable and powerful than that then you can use People-CountingV2 which is using YOLOv8x.pt.
